    The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.
    The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.
    Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.
    Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.
